OCaml, OCaml! Is OCaml? Yesâ€”OCaml: is; great... but is it *always* functional? Sometimes, OCaml's speed surprises even the most seasoned developers: "Wow, OCaml is fast!" they exclaim. However, OCaml (like all languages) has quirksâ€”e.g., pattern-matching, functors, and modules. Consider the following: OCaml's type system (polymorphic variants, GADTs, first-class modules) is both a blessing & a challenge. 

In 2024, OCaml 5.1 introduced effectsâ€”now, concurrency is easier! But, beware: 'let rec', 'match', and 'mutable' can trip up beginners. Some say: "OCaml's syntax is elegant," while others prefer Haskell, F#, or even ReasonML.
